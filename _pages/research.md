<!-- Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation. -->

    <p><strong>Examining the Effects of ADAS on Driving Behaviour Under Indian Driving Conditions.</strong></p>
    <p>The usefulness of ADAS or advanced driver warning systems under Heterogenous Disordered Traffic (HDT) conditions is still not well understood in scientific literature. Too many ADAS warnings can have detrimental effects on drivers' behaviour, particularly when driving larger vehicles (like buses) under densely packed HDT conditions, like on Indian roads. This work will allow us to optimize ADAS for Indian drivers and traffic conditions, reducing driver fatigue and making the drivers more aware of their surroundings, thus improving the overall road safety of bus drivers. For BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation), this will allow them to understand the best ADAS warnings and modalities for their bus drivers.</p>

The usefulness of ADAS or advanced driver warning systems under Heterogenous Disordered Trafiic (HDT) conditions is still not well understood in scientific literature. Too many ADAS warnings can have detrimental effects on drivers' behaviour, particularly when driving larger vehicles (like buses) under densely packed HDT conditions, like on Indian roads. This work will allow us to optimize ADAS for Indian driversand trafiic conditions, reducing driver fatigue and making the drivers more aware of their surroundings, thus improving the overall road safety of bus drivers. For BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation), this will allow them to understand the best ADAS warnings and modalities for their bus drivers.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>**Development of an Integrated Trafiic and Heavy Vehicle Simulator (ITHVS) for Driver Behaviour and Safety Research in India.**</p>

Simulators are recognised as effective tools for driver training around the globe. The proposed advanced Heavy Vehicle (HV) driving simulator can also be utilised for the same. Notably, features such as the realistic representation of Indian trafiic conditions, seamless two-way interaction, and capability to design and test scenarios concerned with intelligent transport systems that most current HV driving simulators lack will offer unprecedented oppotunities for realistic training for the BMTC drivers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>**Deep Clustering based on Self-Supervised Learning for Visual Cluster Structure Assessment (funded by SERB, 2023-2025)**</p>

Clustering is an important unsupervised learning approach for (unlabeled) data mining that partitions the data into groups with similar objects to discover interesting patterns from the dataset. Deep learning-based clustering techniques have recently gained popularity due to their ability to handle complex high-dimensional data. However, these algorithms have limitations, such as the need to specify the number of clusters explicitly beforehand, the lack of information about the inherent cluster structure of datapoints, and difficulties in interpreting the neural network's predictions. To overcome these limitations, researchers have used visual assessment of clustering tendency (VAT) methods to estimate the number of clusters present in data. However, these methods are not practical and are often inconclusive with high-dimensional datasets which is the case in most real-life data. Therefore, this project aims to develop an explainable, self-supervised learning-based visual-analytical framework for cluster structure assessment to discover the deep structures present in complex, high-dimensional data when no ground truths are available.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>**ML-based automotive intrusion detection and prevention system (funded by Tata Elxsi, 2023-2025)**</p>

Modern automobile systems are integrated with advanced communication and computational capabilities, and as a result, they come with many advanced features. However, these advancements render the automobile systems more prone to cyber-attacks. This project focuses on developing unsupervised learning technique on edge device (ECU) to detect and prevent attacks by monitoring the CAN bus traffic data in a car.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>**Development of an Unsupervised Learning-based Model for Cyber-attack detection in Power Grids (funded by Power Grid Centre of Excellence (PGCoE), 2023-2025)**</p>

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\images\projects\ITHVS_Image.jpg){: style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}

The project aims to develop an advanced Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to safeguard power grids in India against cyber-attacks. Given the increasing vulnerability of modern power grids due to the integration of computing and communication (CC) devices, the project will focus on devising unsupervised learning models capable of detecting anomalies across various communication protocols. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques like isolation forest, one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), and autoencoders, the project seeks to enhance the specificity and sensitivity of the detection system. The research involves extensive data analysis using open datasets and synthetic data generation from power grid simulators. The developed models will be evaluated using standard metrics and deployed over GPU-accelerated computing platforms for real-time monitoring. Ultimately, the project's goal is to create a robust and adaptive solution that can effectively detect and prevent cyber threats in the Indian power grid, making it more resilient to dynamic and sophisticated attacks.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>**Simultaneous optimization towards smooth traffic flow in an Urban environment (funded by BEL India, 2023-2025)**</p>

In the era of rapid urbanization driving globalization, the emphasis on smart cities has become central to this process. India, as a developing nation, is poised to construct a significant number of smart cities. However, the pressing challenge remains in designing and implementing an intelligent traffic management system, particularly in densely populated and chaotic traffic scenarios like those in India. The escalating traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and economic losses have underscored the urgent need for an efficient traffic control paradigm. Traditional traffic control methods with signal transitions have proven inadequate, necessitating a paradigm shift towards an automated traffic management system. Considering these aspects, this project aims to develop an innovative data-driven traffic control solution for a selected Indian city, targeting around 40 to 50 major traffic intersections, with the primary objective of ensuring a seamless and optimized traffic flow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>**Video Analytics Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Miscellaneous Object Detection Applications (funded by BEL India, 2023-2025)**</p>

The project aims to leverage the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to create an automated surveillance system. Drones, equipped with high-resolution cameras and AI software, will be used for accurate object detection and tracking, including vehicles and people, even under challenging conditions such as partial occlusion and varied viewpoints. The project specifically targets two critical objectives: (i) real-time tracking of vehicles and individuals on roads and (ii) precise estimation of vehicle queue lengths in dense traffic. Emphasis will be placed on developing efficient algorithms for embedded systems, ensuring optimal performance without overloading the UAV's hardware. By addressing these challenges, the project seeks to contribute to the advancement of effective UAV-based surveillance systems for diverse applications, including traffic monitoring and security.<br/>
