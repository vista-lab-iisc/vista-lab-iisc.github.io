Step 9 in the assembly manual shows how to attach the backrest to the seat. The problem is, there are no grooves in the seat module for the screws to go into. I was able to fit 3 screws into the holes of the backrest attachment but the screws do not fit into the seat attachment. They just slide in and out and the fit is extremely loose. I have double checked the screw types. And I was able to assemble all other parts successfully.
